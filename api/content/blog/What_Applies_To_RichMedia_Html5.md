There’s been a lot of hype around HTML5 banner ads since the technology became available a few years ago. These ads can do a lot more, and as a result have been getting companies [jaw-dropping performance improvements](https://site.adform.com/company/press-releases/adform-benchmarking-report-shows-rich-media-ads-267-more-effective-than-standard-banners/).

But besides the performance, this new ad standard has a lot to offer both the companies running the ads and the users interacting with them. Let’s break down those features so you can better understand what HTML5 ads are, how they work, and what you can do to get the most out of them.

## They work with more platforms and browsers

One main benefit of HTML5 ads is the fact that they work on essentially every platform and modern browser out there. Importantly, they also work natively within apps. So your ads can function the same whether someone is interacting with them on a touchscreen or with a regular cursor.

However, you still face the challenge of coding those ads individually for multiple OS, both mobile and desktop and their browser versions. Here, it’s important to use a trusted and powerful tool to automatically generate all of those versions based on your needs. This could be offline tools like Adobe Animate, Google Web Designer, or online tools like Streameye.

This saves you a lot of time and money as well as providing your users with a far better online experience when they encounter your ads.

## They offer video

As we noted in the introduction, HTML5 ads are leading to enormous improvements for banner ad performance (particularly important when banner ad performance is far from it was back in the ‘banner era’ of the mid 90s). The onset of quality video in banners is perhaps the biggest change they’ve seen since their birth in 1994. After more than two decades, static banners have become background noise for most internet users, leading to the use of video to stand out.

## They can be interactive

The other advantage of video in HTML5 banner ads is that they can be interactive. This makes them more fun, engaging, and worth interacting with for users long since jaded with traditional online advertising. Take one look at these [13 examples](https://instapage.com/blog/interactive-ads) and you’ll see why the capabilities of HTML5 are unlocking the creativity of digital marketing teams and leading to ads which can genuinely delight prospective customers.

## HTML5 ads can be more engaging

Besides using video, HTML5 banner ads also offer other ways to create compelling moving images that grab the attention of users. We’ve had great results using JavaScript along with animation frameworks like Greensock to get smooth animation, interactivity, text effects, and even particle effects.
