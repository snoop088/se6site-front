      "At DAZN we’re constantly promoting live sports all over the world, and our digital asset production is huge, let alone requiring changes in copy, imagery and local nuances. The time taken to develop these creatives in the past has taken too long, and at too high a cost! Using the Streameye tool fixed all of that for us, as we became more agile and far more cost efficient, which we then developed even further with more and more functionality as our understanding of the tool grew.  \nMore importantly, they have been an awesome partner - super-quick in answering the needs of a very busy and demanding business with great innovation and collaboration. We’ve launched in new markets far more seamlessly than ever before, and we know with Streameye that we’re ready for much more in the future.",
