      "At DAZN weâ€™re constantly promoting live sports all over the world, and our digital asset production is huge, let alone requiring changes in copy, imagery and local nuances. The time taken to develop these creatives in the past has taken too long, and at too high a cost! Using the *Streameye* tool fixed all of that for us, as we became more agile and far more cost efficient, which we then developed even further with more and more functionality as our understanding of the tool grew.  \nMore importantly, they have been an awesome partner - super-quick in answering the needs of a very busy and demanding business with great innovation and collaboration. We've launched in new markets far more seamlessly than ever before, and we know with *Streameye* that we're ready for much more in the future.",

      "When you're localising content in over 20 languages and supplying assets in more than 80 different sizes across a variety of different territories, time and costs can quickly skyrocket. However, switching to using *Streameye* as our banner management tool, has helped us become much more agile and efficient. Their integration team have been an excellent partner and has added value by their willingness to make adjustments and customise the software to meet our individual needs. Plus they're fast as lightning which really helps in today's dynamic social media landscape.",
