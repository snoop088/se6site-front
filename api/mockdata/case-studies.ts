After the merger of Betfair and Paddy Power, StreamEye has helped automate and grow their digital ad production.  \n\nUtilising *StreamEye’s Builders and Templates modules*, PPB was able to streamline their ad production across various channels (e.g. affiliate partners, publishing platforms, social media, email marketing, the PPB website, offline betting kiosks). Templates also enabled the PPB team to quickly build and update animated and highly engaging ads.  \n\nBeing one of the first ad content automation solution providers, StreamEye has fully integrated Betfair’s Exchange API to deliver live odds within their animated ads.  \n\nStriving to continuously offer new ideas and methods for digital process optimisation, StreamEye has evolved to develop new modules and features. StreamEye Galleries enabled PPB’s in-house digital team to create and maintain a shared bank of graphic assets (making them available within their digital ads). StreamEye Campaigns offered a breakthrough in ad trafficking by enabling the PPB display team to alter live campaigns without republishing ads.  \n\n![Betfair - Image Creation](/case-ppb-screenshot2.jpeg)",

Through StreamEye’s automated process, the PPB marketing team saves incredible time and effort.  \n\n### Stronger in-house ad creation process  \n StreamEye enabled stronger collaboration between in-house marketing, display and creative teams. Without requiring an external agency to take on production and localisation tasks, StreamEye has saved resources and kept ad production costs at a minimal level.  \n\n### More informative banners  \nPPB’s banners can now contain various elements about contestants, teams and odds. This transforms the ad into a real-time tip, which is especially useful for well-informed potential customers.  \n\n### Embedded videos in banners  \nEmbedding and integrating short TV ads within banners helped PPB strengthen its brand recognition.  \n\n### Scale digital advertising across all channels  \n" +
