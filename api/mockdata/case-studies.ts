Their online, mobile, and sports-led presences have grown their brands to the No.1 position in key markets across the world.  \n\nConsisting of four industry-leading betting and gaming brands (Paddy Power, Betfair, Sportsbet and TVG), Flutter Entertainment became a major disruptor in the online betting industry, thanks to their one-against-one model. Instead of betting on bookmaker odds, fans were able to compete against anonymous players using PPB's “betting exchange”.",

          "Since 2006, Betfair marketing team has relied on StreamEye as their digital partner. After the merger of Betfair and Paddy Power, StreamEye has helped automate and grow their digital ad production.  \n\nUtilising *StreamEye’s Builders and Templates modules*, PPB was able to streamline their ad production across various channels (e.g. affiliate partners, publishing platforms, social media, email marketing, the PPB website, offline betting kiosks). Templates also enabled the PPB team to quickly build and update animated and highly engaging ads.  \n\nBeing one of the first ad content automation solution providers, StreamEye has fully integrated Betfair’s Exchange API to deliver live odds within their animated ads.  \n\nStriving to continuously offer new ideas and methods for digital process optimisation, StreamEye has evolved to develop new modules and features. StreamEye Galleries enabled PPB’s in-house digital team to create and maintain a shared bank of graphic assets (making them available within their digital ads). StreamEye Campaigns offered a breakthrough in ad trafficking by enabling the PPB display team to alter live campaigns without republishing ads.  \n\n![Betfair - Image Creation](/case-ppb-screenshot2.jpeg)",

          "### Highly-relevant HTML5 ads  \nTo promote their products and special offers, PPB is able to produce huge volumes of HTML5 ads that are eye-catching, animated, highly relevant and time-sensitive. In the online betting industry, having highly-relevant ads drives better customer engagement and is crucial for success.  \n\n### Automatically-updated ads  \nThanks to the integration of PPB’s product APIs, ads are automatically updated with live content, consistently showing up-to-date offers and information. Through StreamEye’s automated process, the PPB marketing team saves incredible time and effort.  \n\n### Stronger in-house ad creation process  \n StreamEye enabled stronger collaboration between in-house marketing, display and creative teams. Without requiring an external agency to take on production and localisation tasks, StreamEye has saved resources and kept ad production costs at a minimal level.  \n\n### More informative banners  \nPPB’s banners can now contain various elements about contestants, teams and odds. This transforms the ad into a real-time tip, which is especially useful for well-informed potential customers.  \n\n### Embedded videos in banners  \nEmbedding and integrating short TV ads within banners helped PPB strengthen its brand recognition.  \n\n### Scale digital advertising across all channels  \n" +
